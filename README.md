This project was made for the weekend 4 assignment of Prime Digital Academy. The assignment was to make a basic messageboard. <br><br>
You can find a live version of this project at (be patient while it loads)- https://prime-academy-qotd.herokuapp.com/

Some features of the message board: <br>
  • Box coloring gradates from light to dark blue and back again based on the day the question is posted.<br>
  • New questions are posed on a daily basis and are displayed along with the answers.<br>
  • It animates the addition of new answers and flashes on refresh.
  • It uses adaptive web design. <br>
  
Some of the technologies used:<br>
  • HTML, CSS<br>
  • Bootstrap<br>
  • jQuery<br>
  • Mongo, Mongoose, MongoLab <br>
  • Hosting on Heroku <br>
  
The primary lessons of this project were .json files, and databases. <br>

I plan to improve this project by creating a log-in feature so people can edit their own answers. I'd also like to style it such that a two column rendition doesn't have adjacent boxes misaligned.
